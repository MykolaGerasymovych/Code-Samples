# Code-Samples
This repository includes code samples from my previous projects. In the Data Modeling Code Samples folder you can can find the following:
1) Statistical Inference Course Project. One of the 8 courses of Data Science Specialization I've taken. You can see the codes and reports for the final project.
2) Eesti Pank Project. The aim of the project was to create an Early Warning System model to predict financial distress based on macroeconomic and macrofinancial data. We used non-performing loans variable as a proxy of financial distress and built forecasting models (regressions, logits and signaling models) to predict it. Loan-to-deposit ratio and capital account deficit to GDP variables were the best predictors. You can find my code samples for cleaning and transforming the data, and signaling models, as well as sample data format.

Additionally, as a proof of my knowledge of other programing languages, in the Game Development Code Samples folder you can find the following:
1) Introduction to Programming in Python Course Project. You can see a code for two projects in the course, Black Jack and Space Invaders games, which make use of much of the basic Python structures.
2) Graphical Design and Digital Media Course Project. You can find a code for the final project of the course, my original game Iron Fists, which makes use of much of the basic Java structures.
